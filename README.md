### Hey Folks! 👋

Glad to have you here! 😃✨🎁

This is my safe space to grow and learn more about tech and explore as a beginner anytime. Hoping to make this same for you as well (someday).

I have been aspirational as a kid in tech. 
Confident in design and integration with intuitive problem-solving skills. Proficient in Java, C#, .Net, Python, Kotlin and SQL. Passionate about implementing and delivering new projects. Ability to translate business requirements into technical solutions. Currently working on Dymanics 365 - Power Platform, Customer Engaement, Azure Functions, Plugins and Model Driven Apps, also have a knowledge on Finance and Operations. 

Looking forwad to practice the technical and analytical skills earned while pursuing my degree in Software Engineering (and life :P) towards the attainment of desired goals and simultaneously enriching updates and learnings.
